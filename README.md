*ML Metadata (MLMD)* is a library for recording and retrieving metadata
associated with ML developer and data scientist workflows.

NOTE: ML Metadata may be backwards incompatible before version 1.0.

## Getting Started

For more background on MLMD and instructions on using it, see the
[getting started guide](https://github.com/google/ml-metadata/blob/master/g3doc/get_started.md)

## Installing from PyPI

The recommended way to install ML Metadata is to use the
[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/ml-metadata/):

```bash
pip install ml-metadata
```

Then import the relevant packages:

```python
from ml_metadata import metadata_store
from ml_metadata.proto import metadata_store_pb2
```

### Nightly Packages

ML Metadata (MLMD) also hosts nightly packages at
https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org on Google Cloud. To install the latest
nightly package, please use the following command:

```bash
pip install -i https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple ml-metadata
```

## Installing with Docker

This is the recommended way to build ML Metadata under Linux, and is
continuously tested at Google.

Please first install `docker` and `docker-compose` by following the directions:
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/);
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then, run the following at the project root:

```bash
DOCKER_SERVICE=manylinux-python${PY_VERSION}
sudo docker-compose build ${DOCKER_SERVICE}
sudo docker-compose run ${DOCKER_SERVICE}
```

where `PY_VERSION` is one of `{37, 38, 39, 310}`.

A wheel will be produced under `dist/`, and installed as follows:

```shell
pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Installing from source


### 1. Prerequisites

To compile and use ML Metadata, you need to set up some prerequisites.


#### Install Bazel

If Bazel is not installed on your system, install it now by following [these
directions](https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/install.html).

#### Install cmake
If cmake is not installed on your system, install it now by following [these
directions](https://cmake.org/install/).

### 2. Clone ML Metadata repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/ml-metadata
cd ml-metadata
```

Note that these instructions will install the latest master branch of ML
Metadata. If you want to install a specific branch (such as a release branch),
pass `-b <branchname>` to the `git clone` command.

### 3. Build the pip package

ML Metadata uses Bazel to build the pip package from source:

```shell
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

You can find the generated `.whl` file in the `dist` subdirectory.

### 4. Install the pip package

```shell
pip install dist/*.whl
```

### 5. (Optional) Build the grpc server

ML Metadata uses Bazel to build the c++ binary from source:

```shell
bazel build -c opt --define grpc_no_ares=true  //ml_metadata/metadata_store:metadata_store_server
```

## Supported platforms

MLMD is built and tested on the following 64-bit operating systems:

*   macOS 10.14.6 (Mojave) or later.
*   Ubuntu 16.04 or later.
*   Windows 7 or later.

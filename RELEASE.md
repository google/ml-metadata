# Release 0.25.1

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Adds `reuse_context_if_already_exist` option to `put_execution` python API
    to better support concurrent execution publishing with the same new context.
*   Supports pagination and ordering options in GetExecutionsByContext and
    GetArtifactsByContext APIs.

# Release 0.25.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Supports MetadataStoreClientConfig options `client_timeout_sec` from the
    python client. The grpc APIs would return DeadlineExceededError when server
    does not respond within `client_timeout_ms`.
*   From this release MLMD will also be hosting nightly packages on
    https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org. To install the nightly package use the
    following command:

    ```
    pip install -i https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple ml-metadata
    ```

    Note: These nightly packages are unstable and breakages are likely to
    happen. The fix could often take a week or more depending on the complexity
    involved for the wheels to be available on the PyPI cloud service. You can
    always use the stable version of MLMD available on PyPI by running the
    command `pip install ml-metadata` .

*   Upgrades MLMD schema version to 6.

    -   Add `ParentType` table for supporting type inheritance.
    -   Add `Type`.`version` column for Type evolution development.
    -   Add `Type`.`idx_type_name` index for type lookup APIs.
    -   Add `Type`.`description` column for capturing static information about
        Type.
    -   Add `ParentContext` table for supporting context parental relationship.
    -   Add `Artifact`.`idx_artifact_uri` for filtering artifacts by uri.
    -   Add `Event`.`idx_event_artifact_id` and `idx_event_execution_id` for
        lineage traversal APIs.
    -   Add indices on `create_time_since_epoch`, `last_update_time_since_epoch`
        for `Artifact`, `Execution` and `Context` for sorted listing queries.

*   Allows omitting stored properties when using `put_artifact_type`,
    `put_execution_type`, `put_context_type`, to help writing forward
    compatibility MLMD type registration calls.

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Optimizes GetContext*/GetArtifact*/GetExecution* and corresponding List*
    calls to reduce number of backend queries.
*   Documentation fixes for QueryExecutor methods.

## Breaking Changes

*   N/A

## Deprecations

*   Deprecates `all_fields_match` and `can_delete_fields` from python APIs
    `put_artifact_type`, `put_execution_type`, `put_context_type`. In previous
    releases these parameters can only be set with default values, otherwise
    Unimplemented error returns. This change should be no-op for all existing
    users.

# Release 0.24.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Improves building wheels from source with `setup.py`.
*   Supports configure GRPC options `max_receive_message_length` from the python
    client.

# Release 0.23.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   GetArtifacts, GetExecutions and GetContexts now supports pagination and
    ordering results by ID, Create time and last update time fields.

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Python MetadataStore now exposes get_artifact_by_type_and_name and
    get_execution_by_type_and_name methods.
*   Improves query performance of get_events_by_execution_ids and
    get_events_by_artifact_ids by combing multiple queries.
*   Drops python dependency on tensorflow to make ml-metadata be friendly with
    non-TFX use cases.

## Breaking Changes

*   Python MetadataStore APIs return mlmd errors instead of tensorflow errors.

## Deprecations

*   Note: We plan to remove Python 3.5 support after this release.

# Release 0.22.1

## Major Features and Improvements

# Release 0.22.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Upgrades MLMD schema version to 5.
    -   Added state columns to persistent Artifact.state,
        Execution.last_known_state
    -   Added user-given unique name per type column to Artifact and Execution.
    -   Added create_time_since_epoch, last_update_time_since_epoch to all
        Nodes.

# Release 0.21.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Adding artifact states.
*   Supporting connection retries to gRPC server.
*   Allowing the Python API put_execution to update or insert related contexts.
*   Adding a new execution state: CANCELED. This indicates an execution being
    canceled.
*   Adding two event types: INTERNAL_INPUT and INTERNAL_OUTPUT indended to be
    used by mlmd powered systems (e.g., orchestrator).
*   Add support to pass migration options as command line parameters to the MLMD
    gRPC server.
*   Adding a new Python API get_context_by_type_and_name to allow querying a
    context by its type and context name at the same time.

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Refactoring MetadataAccessObject to allow for more flexibility.

## Breaking Changes

*   The Python API put_execution will need an extra input argument to pass in
    contexts and return updated context_ids. Users using the old API could pass
    in None or an empty list as context and add another variable to hold the
    returned context_ids to migrate.

## Deprecations

# Release 0.15.2

## Major Features and Improvements

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Passes bytes instead of string to grpc.ssl_channel_credentials.
*   Align GRPC python client stub error code with swig client error code.
*   Add verify_server_cert support to MySQL source SSL options.

## Breaking Changes

## Deprecations

# Release 0.15.1

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Add migration options to gRPC MetadataStoreServerConfig.
*   Disable auto schema migration by default during connection. The user needs
    to explicitly enable it when connecting an older database.
*   Support SSL options when using MySQL metadata source.

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Fixes MySQL errors with concurrent connection to an empty database. Now,
    MLMD returns Aborted when concurrent connection error happens and the caller
    can retry appropriately.

## Breaking Changes

## Deprecations

*   Add support for connecting to a MYSQL Metadata Source via Unix sockets.
*   Add support to pass mysql connection configuration as command line
    parameters to the MLMD gRPC server.
*   Provides the ability for metadata_store.py to communicate with the MLMD gRPC
    server, as an alternative to connecting directly with a database.
*   Supports Sqlite for Windows and adds scripts to build wheels for python3 in
    Windows.
*   Provides GetContextTypes to list all Context Types.
*   MLMD ConnectionConfig provides an option to disable an automatic upgrade.
*   Supports downgrade of the database schema version to older versions.

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Depended on `tensorflow>=1.15,<3`
    *   Starting from 1.15, package `tensorflow` comes with GPU support. Users
        won't need to choose between `tensorflow` and `tensorflow-gpu`.
    *   Caveat: `tensorflow` 2.0.0 is an exception and does not have GPU
        support. If `tensorflow-gpu` 2.0.0 is installed before installing
        `ml_metadata`, it will be replaced with `tensorflow` 2.0.0. Re-install
        `tensorflow-gpu` 2.0.0 if needed.
